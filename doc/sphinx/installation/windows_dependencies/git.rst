Git
***
To be able to checkout code it is necessary to install some source code
management (SCM) tools, such as Git. To be
able to checkout the code from our own Git repository, a Git client is
needed. Git is also required for some dependent projects.

Installation of Git requires a lot of choices during installation. We
recommend to simply go with the preselected standard options, except you

Git from a normal Windows Command Prompt:

Git takes up around 225 MB of disk space.

**SCM Tools in Windows Context Menu**

Once you have installed the three SCM tools, you will notice that the
tools have been integrated in the Windows Explorer Context menu. A
right-click on the desktop, or in a folder, will give some
options.
Typically, you will use "Git GUI Here" to checkout a Git project.
