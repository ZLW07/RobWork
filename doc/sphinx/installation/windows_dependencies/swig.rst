SWIG
****
swig is a tool that makes it possible to generate a LUA
script interface for RobWork. Python and Java interfaces are also
possible, but require that Python or Java SDK is installed as well. The
SWIG tool is easily downloaded from:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/swigwin

Please choose version 3 or newer. The tool needs no compilation. Simply
extract the files from the zip-file where you want SWIG installed. Note
down the path to the swig.exe executable. We will refer to this path
later as SWIG\_EXECUTABLE.

SWIG uses only 35 MB.
