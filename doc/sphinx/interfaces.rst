Interfaces
==========

The script interface is generated using `SWIG <http://www.swig.org/>`_ which makes it possible to
interface using many different languages. See http://www.swig.org 
for a complete list of supported languages. 

By default Lua, Python and Java interfaces are generated for RobWork. In this document the use of 
these interfaces will be introduced.  SWIG can not yet generate interfaces for MATLAB, but fortunately
MATLAB provides good support for Java.
