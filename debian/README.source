robwork for Debian
-----------------

This packaging provides the RobWork libraries as individual packages.

Please see http://robwork.org for more information about RobWork.

The folder RobWork/ext/assimp has been removed as it includes external code that does not satisfy the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFGS).
